# Go-Live Checklist

Everything below is a real, currently-open gap between "the app works in dev,
pointed at my own inbox" and "this is safe/correct to put in front of real
guests on sinclairshotels.com." Nothing here is a nice-to-have — each item is
either a security requirement, a data-loss risk, or something that will
silently misbehave (send no email, misroute traffic) if skipped. Check items
off as they're actually done, not just started.

**This file is the Phase 1 cutover set** — the launch-blocking remainder, on
top of everything already built. Phase 2 (post-launch work) and the full split
live in `PLAN.md` → "Scope boundary". A handful of lines below belong to Phase 2
and are marked *(Phase 2)* inline — voucher void/resend and print/PDF, per-user
staff accounts, the Yangang question, and decommissioning the old host (which
can only happen after cutover). Commercials and scope are agreed on a call
before this work starts.

**Last verified against the repo: 2026-09-10.** Ticked items were confirmed in
code/data at that point, not just assumed.

## Preeti's feedback doc

- [ ] **Get the doc and agree which items are in scope for launch.** Named as a
      Phase 1 bucket ("items, not all") but the document isn't in this repo and
      has never been reviewed here, so it is the one launch requirement that
      can't be measured against the code or estimated. Everything else on this
      list is either done or has a known shape; this doesn't. Resolve it early —
      it can only grow Phase 1.

## Email

- [ ] **Verify `sinclairshotels.com` in Resend** (https://resend.com/domains —
      add the domain, add its DNS records, wait for verification). Until this
      is done, all mail sends from `onboarding@resend.dev`, which can only
      deliver to the Resend account's own verified address — see `lib/mail.ts`.
- [ ] Once verified, set `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` (Vercel env, production) to a real
      `@sinclairshotels.com` sender, e.g. `Sinclairs Hotels <noreply@sinclairshotels.com>`.
- [ ] Set `STAFF_NOTIFY_EMAIL` (Vercel env, production) to the real staff inbox
      (legacy used `reservations@sinclairshotels.com`) — currently pinned to
      `subham@sncl.in` in `.env.local` for end-to-end testing only.
- [ ] Clear `MAIL_RECIPIENT_OVERRIDE` in production — while it's set, every
      outbound email (guest voucher copies, enquiry notifications, i-Pay
      confirmations) is redirected to the test address and no real guest or
      staff recipient ever receives anything.
- [ ] Clear `OWNER_BCC_EMAIL` in production once testing is done, unless the
      business wants every outbound email (including guest-facing i-Pay/voucher
      copies) permanently Bcc'd somewhere.
- [ ] Confirm real staff distribution list for the daily digest (currently
      `raviplanet@gmail.com` + `admin@sinclairshotels.com` Bcc, per legacy).

## i-Pay (ICICI Payment Gateway, Standard mode)

CCAvenue (the legacy gateway) has been retired from the codebase — ICICI is
now the only payment gateway, in Standard/redirect mode (card data is
captured on ICICI's own domain, never on this app, keeping it at PCI-DSS
SAQ-A rather than SAQ-D).

- [x] **UAT credentials obtained** — real test-merchant `ICICI_MERCHANT_ID`,
      `ICICI_AGGREGATOR_ID` and `ICICI_HMAC_KEY` from ICICI's onboarding kit
      (Sept 2026) are in `.env.local` with `ICICI_ENV=uat`. Sandbox only —
      never promote these to production.
- [ ] **Do at least one real round-trip test against `pgpayuat.icicibank.com`.**
      The code (`lib/icici.ts`, `app/(site)/ipay/actions.ts`,
      `app/api/ipay/callback/route.ts`) has still never run against ICICI's
      own sandbox — everything below depends on this happening first.
- [ ] Get the **production** merchant credentials (separate from the UAT set
      above) and add them to Vercel env, not `.env.local`.
- [ ] **Resolve the field-naming ambiguity in ICICI's own spec** — Chapter 6
      (Authorize) calls the auth reference `paymentID`, Chapter 7
      (Authorization Redirect) calls the same-looking value `txnAuthID` in
      its sample response. `lib/icici.ts` accepts both defensively, but this
      needs confirming against a real UAT response before launch.
- [ ] Confirm which hash version applies to `initiateSale` — the doc's intro
      calls it "a json request" but never explicitly says "Hash Calculation
      v2" for it (only Get Card Bin / UserCancel / Get Service Charges do).
      Implemented as v1 per the doc's own default rule (Note 2); verify this
      is right against a real sandbox response before trusting it with a
      live transaction.
- [x] Refund/Void — implemented (`callRefund` in `lib/icici.ts`, admin refund
      dialog with source-account display). **Untested against the real
      gateway**; covered by the UAT round-trip item above.
- [ ] Still out of scope, deferred until actually needed: Transaction Status,
      Settlement Summary/Details reconciliation, Generate QR, Get Card Bin,
      Get Service Charges, UserCancel. None of these block a guest completing
      a payment or staff issuing a refund.

## Voucher module

Verified end to end on 2026-09-10 (local): staff login → issue → guest email +
office copy → guest view page. It works; what's open below is scope, not bugs.

- [x] **Issue flow works end to end.** `createVoucher` writes the row, emails
      the guest, sends an office copy (Bcc'd to the booking office and
      `reservations@sinclairshotels.com`), and the guest can open `/v/[token]`.
      Covered by `e2e/voucher.spec.ts` (login → issue → guest view) plus unit
      tests for the form, the view and the action.
- [ ] *(Phase 2)* **Issue-only — there is no edit, void/cancel or resend.** A wrong voucher
      can only be corrected by issuing a second one, and a guest who loses the
      email can't be sent it again. Decide: acceptable at launch, or do void +
      resend go in first?
- [ ] *(Phase 2)* **No print/PDF output** — the guest gets an HTML email and a web page;
      the legacy tool printed. Confirm the properties and front desks accept
      that before cutover.
- [ ] `reservations@sinclairshotels.com` is hardcoded as the office-copy
      fallback recipient (`app/admin/(dashboard)/vouchers/actions.ts`). Confirm
      that mailbox exists and is monitored, or change it.
- [ ] Per-hotel booking-office details are still incomplete — see Data below.

## Analytics

Full specification, funnels and GA4 config in `docs/analytics-events.md`.

- [x] **Nine events implemented in code**: `view_item`, `form_start`,
      `generate_lead`, `begin_checkout`, `add_payment_info`, `purchase`,
      `payment_failed`, `contact_click`, `sign_up` — plus automatic `page_view`.
      Four funnels, each with a calculable drop-off.
- [x] CSP widened for Google Ads, doubleclick, the GA4 regional hosts and
      tagassistant.google.com — without those the Ads tags and GTM Preview are
      silently blocked on this site.
- [ ] **Blocker: GTM edit access.** The available Google account has read-only
      access to container `GTM-NDXBWC`; Edit + Publish at container level is
      needed before any tag work can start.
- [x] **Worked around, not resolved.** Verified against production 2026-09-12
      that the container forwards *none* of the nine events — a hotel page fires
      `view_item`, `contact_click` and `form_start` and the only GA4 hit on the
      wire is `en=page_view`. `lib/analytics.ts` now also sends all nine to
      `G-7Y4FZLC5MW` directly via `gtag.js`, which needs no container access.
      Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA4_ID` to switch it on. **Unset it the moment the
      workspace below is published, or every event is counted twice.**
      See docs/analytics-events.md § Transport.
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID=GTM-NDXBWC` in Vercel env (production). Also
      switches on every "All Pages" legacy tag (Meta pixel, Ads remarketing) for
      this site — a deliberate decision, not a side effect.
- [ ] Build the `next-site-cutover` workspace: 12 variables, 9 triggers, 9 GA4
      tags, 4 Ads conversion tags (copies of the legacy tags with the trigger
      swapped, since the conversion IDs live in those tags).
- [ ] GA4 admin: register 9 custom dimensions, mark the 5 key events, confirm
      enhanced measurement history-change tracking is on. Do this *before*
      verifying — unregistered parameters look like broken tags.
- [ ] Verify in GTM Preview + GA4 DebugView against the Vercel deploy, then
      publish the workspace (publishing touches the container serving the live
      WordPress site — needs sign-off).
- [ ] **Every legacy conversion breaks at cutover.** All of them fire on
      WordPress URLs (`/thank-you/?form=…`, `pay-success`) or Elementor click
      classes (`bebtn_*`) that don't exist here. Rebuilding them against the
      events above is what keeps Google Ads reporting conversions at all.
- [ ] Tell whoever runs Google Ads (TechSol / Web-Connect are both active in the
      container) before cutover, so spend isn't optimising against zero
      conversions.
- [ ] **Do all of the above before DNS cutover**, so there's a genuine
      before/after baseline rather than a gap at the switch.

## Server logs (Vercel)

`lib/log.ts` writes one line of JSON per server event, which Vercel indexes into
filterable fields — search these in the project's Logs tab (or `vercel logs`).
This is the server-side record of the funnel, independent of GA4: it survives ad
blockers, a guest closing the tab, and the GTM container blocker above, so when
GA4 and the database disagree this is the tiebreaker.

| Event | Fires when | Client counterpart |
|---|---|---|
| `enquiry.created` | lead committed to Postgres | `generate_lead` |
| `enquiry.invalid` / `enquiry.spam_blocked` / `enquiry.rate_limited` | submission rejected | *(none — rejected leads fire nothing)* |
| `newsletter.subscribed` / `newsletter.duplicate` / `newsletter.spam_blocked` | subscribe outcome | `sign_up` |
| `ipay.initiated` | Payment row created, before the gateway call | `add_payment_info` |
| `ipay.settled` | ICICI's signed callback verified and applied | `purchase` / `payment_failed` |
| `ipay.callback.replayed` | duplicate callback ignored | *(explains a duplicate purchase)* |
| `ipay.callback.rejected` | bad signature, unknown order, missing id | *(security signal)* |
| `ipay.callback.amount_mismatch` | gateway amount ≠ order amount | *(tamper/replay signal)* |
| `ipay.gateway_unreachable` / `ipay.gateway_rejected` | initiateSale failed | *(none — guest never reaches ICICI)* |
| `mail.sent` / `mail.send_failed` / `mail.skipped_no_provider` | staff/guest notification | — |

Guest data never reaches a log line: `lib/log.ts` redacts `name`, `email`,
`phone`, `message`, IPs and mail recipients by key name, so an accidental
`log.info('x', { email })` prints `[redacted]` rather than the address. Log ids
and slugs, and join to Postgres when the personal detail is actually needed.

- [ ] After cutover, spot-check `enquiry.created` count against the `Enquiry`
      table and against GA4's `generate_lead` for the same day. Three sources
      agreeing is the only real proof the funnel is wired end to end.

## Production environment (Vercel)

Every variable the code actually reads, and its go-live state. Anything unset
in production either breaks (`DATABASE_URL`, `ADMIN_*`) or silently does
nothing (`NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID`, `RESEND_API_KEY`).

- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` — production Postgres (Neon/Supabase), not the local Docker one.
- [ ] `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` — fresh production values, not
      the local dev ones.
- [ ] `CRON_SECRET` — see Security below.
- [ ] `RESEND_API_KEY`, `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`, `STAFF_NOTIFY_EMAIL`,
      `DIGEST_TO_EMAIL`, `DIGEST_BCC_EMAIL` — see Email above.
- [ ] `MAIL_RECIPIENT_OVERRIDE`, `OWNER_BCC_EMAIL` — must be **absent** in
      production, not set to something harmless.
- [ ] `ICICI_MERCHANT_ID`, `ICICI_AGGREGATOR_ID`, `ICICI_HMAC_KEY`,
      `ICICI_ENV=prod` — production merchant credentials, never the UAT set.
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID` — see Analytics above. One env var, and the only
      way to get a before/after baseline; do it before cutover, not after.
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA4_ID` — `G-7Y4FZLC5MW`. The direct-to-GA4 workaround for
      the container blocker above. Mutually exclusive with published GTM tags
      for the same events.
- [ ] `SITE_BASE_URL` — currently overrides the base URL for absolute links in
      emails/vouchers because `sinclairshotels.com` still serves WordPress
      (`lib/site-url.ts`). **Remove the override at cutover**, once
      `siteConfig.url` is genuinely this app.

## Data

- [x] **Historical data migration — done (2026-09-08): four legacy tables from
      three MySQL databases.** Re-verified locally 2026-09-10: 35,837
      enquiries, 13,539 vouchers, 26,258 newsletter subscribers, and 5,234
      legacy payments (`cca_status`, the old CCAvenue/HDFC gateway log, added
      in a second pass). Re-running inserts 0 rows. Skips are small and
      reasoned in `dumps/migration-report.json` — 53 enquiries, 3 vouchers, 40
      payments, all unmapped-property or unparseable-date.
- [ ] Confirm those counts in **production**. The figures above were checked
      against local dev; the production import ran on 2026-09-08 and hasn't
      been re-counted since.
- [ ] **Final catch-up import immediately before cutover** — the legacy site is
      still live and still collecting enquiries/vouchers/signups every day. The
      import is insert-only, so it picks up new rows but not edits to rows
      already imported.
- [ ] Real per-hotel booking-office data (GSTIN, address, phone, email) — the
      legacy `voucher_hotels` table has this and was never pulled.
      `content/site.ts` lists the head office only, so vouchers show incomplete
      billing details.
- [ ] **Decide what happens to the masked-card table** (`sinclairsltd_hdfcmpgs`)
      — never imported, and not among the four dumps we hold. Recommendation:
      import nothing. Masked PAN + expiry is cardholder-adjacent data with no
      operational use in the new app — ICICI Standard mode means card data
      never touches us — and importing it would pull a PCI question into a
      system that currently has none. Whichever way we go, it needs to be
      explicitly destroyed with the legacy box, not just left behind on it.
- [ ] **Decide on the unused legacy tables** — `voucher_users`, `voucher_admin`
      and `admin_pass` (the old staff logins, superseded by `ADMIN_PASSWORD`)
      are referenced by the legacy PHP but were never imported. Default: don't
      import. Treat those password hashes as compromised — that box had a
      webshell — and confirm nobody reuses those credentials elsewhere.
- [ ] *(Phase 2)* Decide what "Sinclairs Yangang" is (1,043 enquiries + 58 vouchers,
      confirmed in the local DB) — imported verbatim rather than folded into
      `gangtok`, pending a call on whether it's a separate property.

Note: legacy free text carries attack payloads — `migration-report.json` shows
enquiry rows containing PHP object-injection probes submitted to the old form.
They're stored as inert text and React escapes them on render, so nothing
executes today. Keep it that way: don't add `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or a raw
HTML export to any admin view that shows imported content.

## Security

- [ ] **Legacy GoDaddy server**: a webshell/backdoor was found and quarantined
      locally during migration research but **the live host itself was never
      remediated** — credentials need rotating and the box needs a real scan.
      This is independent of the Next.js rebuild and can't be done from here.
- [ ] *(not launch-blocking)* Generate and set a real `CRON_SECRET` in Vercel
      env. The route fails closed — with no secret set it returns 401 to
      everyone, including Vercel's own cron — so the only consequence of
      skipping it is that the daily digest email never sends. No security hole.
- [ ] The legacy sync script (`sync-legacy-data.sh`) is **no longer on disk** as
      of 2026-09-10 — only the dumps it produced remain, under
      `~/Desktop/sinclairs-wp-backup/legacy-php-site/dumps/`. If the pre-cutover
      catch-up import needs it, it has to be rewritten; when it is, it holds the
      legacy MySQL root password in plaintext and SSHes into a compromised box,
      so delete it (and the dumps) once the import is confirmed complete rather
      than leaving either lying around post-cutover.
- [ ] *(Phase 2)* Admin auth is currently a single shared `ADMIN_PASSWORD` —
      fine to launch with, but revisit for real per-user accounts once more
      than a couple of people use `/admin`.

## Cutover

- [x] **301 redirects from the old WordPress URL structure to the new one.**
      Built in `lib/legacy-redirects.ts`, wired via `next.config.ts`'s
      `redirects()`. All 187 live legacy URLs verified against a production
      build: 185 redirect to a page that returns 200, and `/` and `/media`
      already exist at the same path.

      The inventory came from **crawling the live site**, not its sitemap —
      `sinclairshotels.com/sitemap.xml` is stale third-party output that misses
      every `/gangtok*` URL, all of `/palace-udaipur*`, and the whole
      `/reservations.php?ht=…` set. It is committed as
      `lib/legacy-redirects.fixture.json`, and the test asserts every URL in it
      lands on a real route, so a future route rename fails CI instead of
      silently creating 404s.

      Shape of the map: `/<property>` and `/<property>-<anything>` collapse onto
      `/hotels/<slug>` (rooms, dining, conference, gallery and packages are all
      sections of one page now); the old booking engine's
      `?ht=<CODE>` query is decoded back to the property so
      `/reservations.php?ht=GAN&rm=GDR` keeps its property instead of dumping
      everyone on `/hotels`; per-property factsheet PDFs go to the property they
      described. `portblair` → `port-blair` and `palace-udaipur` → `udaipur` are
      the two prefixes that differ from the slug.

      Legacy query params ride through to the destination
      (`/hotels/gangtok?ht=GAN`), which is harmless — the canonical tag on the
      destination is the clean URL either way, verified.
- [ ] DNS: point `sinclairshotels.com` at Vercel once everything above is done.
      The canonical host is **`https://www.sinclairshotels.com`** — that is what
      `siteConfig.url` emits in every canonical, OG URL and sitemap entry, and
      what the legacy site already 301s `http://` apex and `http://www` to.
- [ ] **Serve the apex, don't just park it.** `https://sinclairshotels.com`
      (apex, TLS) currently answers `200` on the old stack instead of
      redirecting to `www` — so the legacy site is reachable under two HTTPS
      hostnames with no redirect between them. Add both domains in Vercel with
      apex → `www` as a redirect, or the same split carries over to the new
      stack.
- [ ] **Remove `SITE_BASE_URL` from Vercel production.** One variable, two
      effects: absolute links in emails/vouchers switch to the real domain
      (`lib/site-url.ts`), and `robots.txt` flips from `Disallow: /` to
      `Allow: /` (`app/robots.ts`). Until it is removed the new site stays
      deliberately un-indexable, because every canonical it emits points at
      WordPress URLs that are still 404s (`/weddings`, `/meetings-events`,
      `/enquiry`, every `/hotels/<slug>` — verified 2026-09-12). Leaving it set
      after cutover silently keeps the live site out of Google.
- [ ] Resubmit `sitemap.xml` in Google Search Console after cutover, and keep
      the old property in Search Console long enough to watch the 301s being
      picked up (Coverage → "Page with redirect" should climb as 404s fall).
- [ ] **No privacy policy, terms or cookie notice exists on the new site.** The
      old one had `/privacy-policy`, `/policy` and `/tnc`; all three currently
      301 to the homepage, which is a stopgap, not a mapping. The site collects
      names, emails and phone numbers through the enquiry form and processes
      card payments through ICICI, so these pages need to exist before cutover —
      redirecting a legal page to home is both an SEO soft-404 and the wrong
      answer to a guest looking for it.
- [ ] Connect the GitHub repo in Vercel for auto-deploy-on-push (currently
      blocked on a one-time manual GitHub login connection in the Vercel
      dashboard) — until then, ship via `vercel deploy --prod`.
- [ ] *(Phase 2)* Decommission the GoDaddy hosting once DNS has fully cut over and the
      final catch-up import (above) is confirmed complete.
