// answers on several hostnames with the same build at once —
// sinclairs-hotels.vercel.app, dev.sinclairshotels.com,
// staff.dev.sinclairshotels.com and every preview URL. An env-based rule opens
// or closes all of them together, so at cutover the dev subdomain would have
// begun serving a crawlable, full duplicate of the live site. Only the canonical
// host is ever crawlable; every other host stays closed before and after
// cutover, with no step to remember.
//
// Until DNS moves, no request can arrive on the canonical host at all, so this
// also keeps the pre-cutover deployment out of the index — which matters because
// every canonical it emits points at a WordPress URL that is still a 404, and
// Google discards a canonical that resolves to a 404 and indexes the crawled URL
// instead.
