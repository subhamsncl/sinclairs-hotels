# Execution Plan — WordPress → Next.js Rebuild

## Background

The current live site (sinclairshotels.com) runs WordPress + Elementor +
MotoPress Hotel Booking, self-hosted. During migration research a local Docker
copy of the production codebase (`sinclairs-wpcm`) was found to contain a
planted backdoor in `wp-content/cache/` — a fake `wp-config.php` that pulls and
executes remote PHP, plus a Perl webshell. It was quarantined locally
(`~/Desktop/sinclairs-wp-backup/QUARANTINE_backdoors/`), but **the live host
still needs credential rotation and a server-side scan** — that's outside what
this repo or Claude Code can do. This rebuild also removes WordPress as an
attack surface going forward.

Decisions already made (2026-09-01):
- Content is fully static in Next.js — no headless WordPress at runtime.
- DB: PostgreSQL + Prisma, for enquiry/lead submissions only.
- Hosting: Vercel.
- Scope: full site (Home, Hotels listing + per-property pages, Meetings,
  Weddings, Enquiry form, Contact), matching the current nav.
- Repo: `github.com/subhamsncl/sinclairs-hotels` (public).

## Phases

### Phase 0 — Scaffold (foundation, do first, sequential)
- `create-next-app` with TypeScript (strict), App Router, Tailwind, pnpm
- Swap ESLint/Prettier for **Biome** (`biome.json`); wire `pnpm lint`
- Prisma init, `Enquiry` model, local Postgres via Docker Compose for dev
- Test tooling: Vitest + React Testing Library configured, Playwright
  installed with one smoke test as a template
- GitHub Actions CI: lint, unit tests, build on every push/PR
- Base layout: nav (with Hotels dropdown), footer, design tokens (colors,
  type scale) matching Sinclairs' brand (deep green + gold accent, serif
  display type — see current site screenshots)
- `content/types.ts`: `Hotel`, `HotelPage`, `NavItem` interfaces
- Deploy an empty shell to Vercel early, to de-risk hosting/env setup

### Phase 1 — Content extraction (can run in parallel once Phase 0 lands)
- Pull copy + structure from the WP export
  (`~/Desktop/sinclairs-wp-backup/WPCM`, `public_html` as fallback for older
  copy) for: Home, About, each of the 9 properties, Meetings & Events,
  Weddings, Contact
- Export/optimize images from `wp-content/uploads` into `public/images/`
  (re-encode/resize — do not ship the WP originals as-is)
- Write content into typed `content/hotels/*.ts` files

### Phase 2 — Pages (parallelizable across properties once content model is fixed)
- Home page (hero, featured properties, awards, Instagram-style gallery —
  simplified, no third-party embed dependency unless requested)
- Hotels listing page + dropdown nav + 9 individual property pages
  (rooms, dining, facilities, gallery, sightseeing — reuse one template
  component, not 9 bespoke pages)
- Meetings & Events, Weddings — content pages with enquiry CTA
- Contact page

### Phase 3 — Enquiry system
- Prisma `Enquiry` model (name, email, phone, property, dates, message,
  createdAt, status)
- Server action / API route: zod validation, rate limiting, honeypot or
  equivalent spam guard, Prisma insert
- Email notification on submission (transactional email provider — TBD, ask
  before adding a paid dependency)
- Confirmation UI state (success/error), no page reload required

### Phase 4 — Polish & launch readiness
- Accessibility pass (landmarks, alt text, focus states, color contrast)
- SEO: metadata API per page, sitemap.xml, robots.txt, OpenGraph images
- Performance: image optimization, Lighthouse pass, ISR where useful
- Security review: headers (CSP, HSTS via Vercel), dependency audit,
  form abuse protection
- Cross-browser/responsive check in Chrome via claude-in-chrome

## Scope boundary — Phase 1 vs Phase 2

Agreed 2026-09-10. **Phase 1 is everything the site cannot go live without:
what has already been built, plus the cutover set. Phase 2 is everything that
comes after launch.** (The numbered build phases 0–4 above are an older,
unrelated axis; don't confuse them.)

An earlier cut of this section split the phases by done vs remaining. That was
wrong: it put the entire cutover set in Phase 2, which would have meant
"Phase 1 complete" and "site still on WordPress" at the same time.

**Commercials and scope are settled on a call before further work starts** —
covering both the cutover set below and Phase 2.

### Phase 1 — done

- All 9 property pages, plus home, hotels listing, weddings, meetings & events,
  contact, media and enquiry pages
- Enquiry system end to end: zod validation, rate limiting, spam guard, Prisma
  insert, staff notification email, success/error states
- Voucher module: issue → guest email → office copy → guest-viewable
  `/v/[token]` page
- Internal ops dashboard on the `staff.*` host: enquiries, vouchers, payments
  (with refunds), newsletter, session auth
- ICICI i-Pay integration in Standard/redirect mode, including refunds, signed
  callback verification and the amount cross-check
- Historical data migration: 35,837 enquiries, 13,539 vouchers, 26,258
  newsletter subscribers, 5,234 legacy payments — verified idempotent
- GA4/GTM instrumentation with the full conversion funnel
- On-page SEO: per-page metadata, sitemap, robots, schema.org structured data
- Security hardening: CSP and the standard headers, rate limiting, timing-safe
  secret comparison, server-side validation everywhere, staff-host isolation
- Daily digest email (cron)
- Design system and shared component library
- Test suite (68 unit tests + Playwright e2e) and the CI pipeline

### Phase 1 — the cutover set (remaining, launch-blocking)

Finite, and mostly not code — credentials, DNS, one redirect map and a data
pull. Detail for every line lives in `GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md`.

- 301 redirect map from the old WordPress URLs, DNS switch to Vercel, sitemap
  resubmission in Search Console
- Resend domain verification, real from/staff addresses, test recipient
  overrides removed — without this no real guest or staff address receives
  anything
- Production environment variables in Vercel: GTM ID, `CRON_SECRET`, production
  database and admin secrets, and dropping the `SITE_BASE_URL` override
- ICICI: sandbox round-trip (which also settles the two open questions in their
  spec), then production credentials and one live test
- Legacy server credential rotation and clean-rebuild confirmation
- GA4 verified firing in production *before* cutover, so the before/after
  baseline exists
- Final catch-up data import, plus re-confirming the production row counts
- Per-hotel booking-office details from the legacy `voucher_hotels` table, so
  vouchers bill correctly
- The masked-card and unused-legacy-table decisions — they are security
  questions and they execute at decommission
- Triage of Preeti's feedback doc: which of those items are launch-blocking

### Phase 2 — after launch

- Legacy host decommission (only possible once cutover is verified)
- Voucher void/resend and print/PDF — unless the front desk needs them on day
  one, in which case they move into the cutover set
- Per-user staff accounts instead of the shared admin password
- Conversion dashboard (event collection is already done; somewhere to look at
  it is not launch-blocking)
- Offers page and pricing dashboard
- Web check-in
- Payment/voucher reconciliation (needs a `Voucher` → `Payment` link first)
- New content: careers, destination guides, F&B
- The "Sinclairs Yangang" property question — the 1,043 enquiries are imported
  and safe under either answer, so it changes nothing at launch
- STAAH integration — unscoped; it changes the site's commercial model and
  needs its own scoping before it can be estimated
- AI integration and further visual redesign — parked, refine rather than replace

## Post-launch roadmap ("Phase 2")

Naming note: the numbered phases above are the *build* phases (0–4, all
delivered). "Phase 1 / Phase 2" as used in stakeholder conversation means
launch / post-launch — this section is the latter. Status verified against the
repo on 2026-09-10.

### Already built (landed early, during the launch push)

- **Internal ops dashboard** — `/admin`, reachable only on the `staff.*` host
  (`proxy.ts` rewrites it to a 404 on the public host), session-cookie auth,
  sidebar nav. Sections: Enquiries (legacy imported records shown separately),
  Vouchers (list + create + guest-visible `/v/[token]` link), Payments (with
  refund dialog), Newsletter. Plus the daily digest cron email.
  *Remaining:* per-user staff accounts instead of one shared password (see
  `GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md` → Security), and whatever ops asks for after real use.
- **Conversion tracking (data collection only)** — the GA4 funnel fires
  end-to-end: `page_view`, `begin_checkout` (booking widget + reservation
  links), `generate_lead` (enquiry submit), `purchase` / `payment_failed`
  (i-Pay result). What does not exist is anywhere to *look* at it — see the
  open decision below.

### Partly done

- **Payment / voucher reconciliation** — `Payment` and `Refund` are modelled
  and populated only from ICICI's signed callback (`orderId`, `trackingId`/
  `bankRefNo`, `paymentMode`/`paymentInstId`). But `Voucher` has no `paymentId`
  or any FK to `Payment`, so nothing can currently say "this voucher was paid
  by that transaction." Needs: a schema link, ICICI's Transaction Status +
  Settlement Summary/Details calls (both still deferred in
  `GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md` → i-Pay), and a reconciliation view in `/admin`.
- **Legacy host decommission** — no work in this repo; blocked entirely on
  cutover (DNS + final catch-up import). The daily legacy sync script retires
  at the same moment.

### Not started

- **Offers page + pricing dashboard** — no route, no content file, no model.
  First feature that genuinely needs ISR rather than plain SSG (see CLAUDE.md's
  note about an admin-curated offers banner). If pricing is staff-editable this
  is two features: the marketing page, plus a Prisma model and admin CRUD.
- **Web check-in** — largest item on this list. New guest-facing flow, new
  model, identity-document handling (and the retention question that brings),
  a link from the voucher/confirmation email. Needs scoping before estimating —
  see the open decision below.
- **Careers / destination guides / F&B pages** — none exist; `content/` has
  awards, experiences, hotels, legal, reviews, site. These follow the
  established pattern (typed content file + page reusing `EditorialRow` and
  friends), so Careers and F&B are genuinely quick. Destination guides are the
  outlier: the cost is photography and copy, not code, and the WP uploads
  folder is gone from this machine (see CLAUDE.md → Source content), so new
  destination imagery has to come from an external backup or a fresh shoot.
  Add every new top-level route to `app/sitemap.ts`'s `staticPaths`.

### Needs scoping before it can be placed in a phase

- **STAAH integration** (raised 2026-09-10) — STAAH is a channel manager: rate
  and inventory distribution to OTAs, plus a booking engine. Nothing in this
  plan accounts for it, and it changes the premise the current site is built
  on: today the enquiry form is the only commercial path, and a guest cannot
  book online. Wiring STAAH in means live availability and rates, a booking
  flow, and a payment step that belongs to a real reservation rather than the
  standalone i-Pay page — that is a product decision, not a feature ticket, and
  it interacts with the i-Pay work already done. Scope it on its own before
  slotting it anywhere; do not treat it as a Phase 2 line item alongside a
  careers page.

### Parked, deliberately

- **AI integration** and **further visual redesign**. Position of record: refine
  the existing design system rather than replace it, and don't scope the
  redesign question now.

### Open decisions (blocking estimates)

1. **Conversion dashboard: GA4 exploration, or an in-app page?** The events
   already fire, so a GA4 exploration costs no code. An in-app page is more
   work but reads our own Postgres — `Enquiry`, `Payment` and `Voucher` are all
   indexed on `createdAt` + `hotelSlug`, so enquiries→payments by property and
   date is a straightforward query. Very different amounts of work.
2. **Web check-in scope** — does it write back into something the front desk
   actually uses, or is it a standalone form that emails them? And which
   identity documents, if any, do we store, for how long?

### Suggested order

Content pages (cheap, no dependencies) → offers/pricing → reconciliation →
conversion dashboard → web check-in. Decommission slots in whenever cutover
completes.

## Working agreement

- Commit early and often to `main` (or short-lived branches) on the public
  repo, small reviewable chunks — not one giant PR at the end.
- Each phase's pages get a real visual check (dev server + browser
  screenshot) before being marked done — not just "it compiles."
- Ask before adding any paid/third-party service (email provider, image CDN,
  analytics).
